                                It wasn’t long ago that coding was seen by many as an odd hobby for geeks tinkering with computers in their basements. But over the past several years, coding has progressed from a hobby to a critical career skill. Even better for those hobbyists? Employers have shown a willingness to pay a premium for the work of employees with coding and programming ability.

                                    1. Coding and programming careers have great earning potential.
                                    One of the strongest and most obvious draws of learning to code is the earning potential for coding and programming professionals. 
                                    The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tracks salary and other important workforce information for a variety of careers. 
                                    Take a look at the BLS’ 2019 median annual salary information for these coding and programming-related professions:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Web developers: $73,760</li>
                                    <li>Network and computer systems administrators: $83,510</li>
                                    <li>Computer programmers: $86,550</li>
                                    <li>Database administrators: $93,750</li>
                                    <li>Software developers: $107,510</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br>
                                To put it into perspective, the national average for all occupations in 2019 was $39,810. 
                                As you can see, careers that involve some programming, coding or scripting skills tend to come with above-average salaries.
                                </p>
                                <p id="anchor_img_job" style="text-align: left;">2. Demand remains strong for coding-related jobs
                                    What good is a strong salary if no one is looking to hire for the position? When it comes to coding-related jobs, it appears there’s still plenty of opportunity. 
                                    Here are the current BLS projections for employment growth in the same coding and programming-related professions:
                                </p>
                                <p>   
                                <br>Web developers: 13%
                                <br>Network and computer systems administrators: 5%
                                <br>Computer programmers: -7%
                                <br>Database administrators: 9%
                                <br>Software developers: 21%
                                </p>
                                    When compared to the national average of five percent growth, you can see that a handful of positions are outpacing a lot of other careers. 
                                    Computer programmers are an interesting outlier from this group, but some believe these projections are influenced 
                                    by computer programming skills blending into other related in-demand tech roles. 
                                    While the role is still extremely valuable, more and more hybrid positions are being introduced into the workforce. 
                                    This has resulted in less “computer programmer” job postings, and more opportunities that combine programming skills into other job titles.

                                        3. Give Push to Memory And Cognitive Skills. <br>
                                        As we began to age, our ability to remember things declines, but in one of the studies, it is found 
                                        that “intellectually engaging activities serve to buffer individuals against [cognitive] decline.”
                                    <br><br>In simple words: Engaging in cognitive intensive skills such as coding helps to fight back against memory loss.
                                        The human brain basically consists of two hemispheres: left and right. 
                                        The right hemisphere is responsible for intuitive thinking and imagination, whereas the left hemisphere is responsible for all analytical and logical thinking.
                                        Engaging in programming improves the functions of both hemispheres which in turn, develops the brain as a whole.
                                    <br><br>Programming is basically a mental engagement that actually leads to sharper brains, constructs cognitive aptitudes that involve learning
                                         and intellectual difficulty, and moves forward a person’s memory.
                                         According to Alan Perlis, a Turing award winner, and writer of the Algol language: learning a programming language can change the way a person thinks. 
                                         He also stated that “A language that doesn’t affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.”

My house is definitely cleaner than normal.” But there is a risk you could be more sedentary, she warned.
